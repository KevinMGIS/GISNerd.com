        Working on personal projects with no other outcome but to say I did it has sparked my creativity and completely changed how I approach my day-to-day work. These projects aren’t for a client, a deadline, or even a resume bullet, they’re experiments, challenges, or just ideas I want to explore. And that freedom to explore has pushed me to think differently.

        I now find myself constantly looking for better ways to do things. I’ve started questioning old habits and manual workflows, and instead, I’m building more repeatable steps and scripting out tasks that I used to do by hand. Things are becoming cleaner, more efficient, and a lot more scalable.

        Learning to code — and getting comfortable with the libraries and tools that support it — has really opened things up for me. Each new skill has unlocked something else. It’s like having a new lens to look at problems through.

        So if you’re on the fence about diving into a project just for the sake of learning… do it. You never know where it might lead.
