      <h1>Hey! It's me, the GIS Nerd.</h1>
      <p>
        A little history about me – I graduated with a degree in Environmental Science (a long time ago). After college, I worked as an Environmental Scientist, specializing in Endangered Species and Wetlands Permitting. That’s where I first encountered GIS, think late ‘90s, early 2000s.

        I was instantly fascinated. The marriage of technology and mapping, all in the hands of regular people? The potential was obvious. I dove in, learning everything I could. But as luck would have it, my career path took me further into technology and management, pulling me away from GIS work. I tried to stay connected, but with the rapid pace of technological change and a busy family, it was tough.

        And I missed it. Something about GIS just clicked for me, and I never lost that feeling.

        As it turns out, you can always come home. A few months ago, I had the opportunity to step into a new role as a GIS and IT Manager for a civil engineering firm. I jumped in with both feet, and suddenly, I was back in the world I had always loved.

        The best part? I’m learning again. ArcGIS Pro, Python, ArcPy, ArcGIS Online – diving into these tools has been both challenging and exciting.

        So far, it’s been a great ride. I feel re-energized, passionate about my work again, and I can’t wait to see what’s next.
