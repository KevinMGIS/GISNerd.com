      <h1>Trips: Building Something Worth the Journey</h1>
      <p>
        My wife and I recently made a commitment to travel and get away more. I am not talking about major trips or long vacations, but quick escapes from Friday morning to Sunday night. Something that lets us explore a new place, learn its vibe, and hit the highlights. A short refresh and reset in a different setting.

        While planning our first of these getaways, somewhere in the middle of all the debating and deciding, I realized there had to be a better way. Being the GISNerd that I am, and feeling the coding itch, I decided to build something small for us to use not only for planning but also during the trip. I also added a “Look Back” section that allows us to plot photos on a map and turn our memories into a kind of travel journal. And Trips was born.

        Could I have found an app that already did this? Of course I could have. But where is the fun in that?

        What started as a simple travel tool for the two of us ended up reminding me why I love building things in the first place. There were no deadlines, no clients, and no expectations. Just an idea, a bit of curiosity, and a few quiet nights spent creating something meaningful.

        That same feeling has carried over into the rebuild of GISNerd.com. For a long time, my site was more of a résumé than anything else—a static place to list projects and technical skills. Now I want it to feel more alive and more reflective of who I am and what I value. Trips reminded me that the best projects are not about showing off what you can build. They are about creating something that captures your energy and purpose in that moment.

        As I rebuild GISNerd.com, I am keeping that mindset. I want it to be simpler, cleaner, and more intentional. Less noise and more meaning. A space that, like Trips, helps me reconnect with what matters most: creating, exploring, and finding joy in the process.

        Because whether it is a weekend away or a website rebuild, sometimes the best journeys are the ones that bring you back to yourself.
