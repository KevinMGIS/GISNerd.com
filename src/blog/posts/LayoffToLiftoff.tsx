      <h1>From Layoff to Liftoff</h1>
      <h2>The Layoff…</h2>
      <p>
        In July 2024, I was laid off from not one, but two positions. I won’t bore you with the details, but needless to say, I was no longer the Chief Information Officer of a national title company or the President of a software development firm. I was humbled. I lost my identity. It was a low point.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a few months of searching within the title insurance industry and not having any luck, I decided it was time for a serious look in the mirror. I needed to find happiness. Don’t get me wrong, I wasn’t miserable in my previous roles, but I wasn’t fulfilled either. And I was definitely burnt out. I needed a change. I needed to wake up excited about my work again. I needed to love what I was doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I reflected on my career and experiences, I kept coming back to GIS. I remembered the joy I felt early in my career when I worked in that field. The curiosity and fascination were still there. So I dove back in, researching how the industry had evolved while I was away. The more I read, the more excited I got. The software had improved. Data availability had exploded. GIS had become deeply integrated with the web. All of it sparked something in me again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even better, I realized I could now apply the skills I’d developed in the IT world—like Python and SQL—in a field I truly cared about.
      </p>

      <h2>Liftoff…</h2>
      <p>
        Earlier this year, I was extremely fortunate to land a role as GIS and IT Manager for a civil engineering firm. This opportunity came thanks in part to some strong prior relationships. It followed seven months of unemployment and more than 100 job applications. I couldn’t have been more ecstatic. I finally had a chance to do what I’m passionate about (GIS) and what I’m good at (IT).
      </p>
      <p>
        I jumped in with both feet. After spending some time getting the firm’s IT systems modernized and automated, I’ve now carved out most of my time to focus on GIS and everything it can do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond the core work, like parcel searches for developers or environmental assessments, I’ve been diving into coding with GIS. Using Python and ArcPy, I’ve been able to automate processes and push beyond what the standard tools offer. It’s been a rewarding and eye-opening experience. My mind is constantly buzzing with ideas. Honestly, even my free time is now spent learning, experimenting, and building out my passion project: GISNerd.com.
      </p>

      <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
      <p>
        This journey has reminded me that it’s never too late to rediscover your passion and start a new chapter. Losing my former roles wasn’t the end—it was the beginning of something better. I’ve found renewed purpose, joy in my work, and a clear vision for the future. Whether it’s building tools, solving spatial problems, or sharing what I learn through GISNerd.com, I finally feel like I’m exactly where I’m supposed to be.
      </p>

        If you’ve been through something similar, or you’re still in the thick of it, know that it’s okay to start over. Sometimes, the best version of your career comes after the hardest reset.
